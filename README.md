# Windmill-Energy
A windmill energy simulation project with adjustable gears and PWM control. It uses a button to cycle through gears (1-5) and adjusts motor speed accordingly. The system displays gear and PWM values on an LCD. PWM brightness is gradually distributed across 5 LEDs to simulate energy levels.
