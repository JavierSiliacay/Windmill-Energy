Begin by setting up the hardware components, which include the button, motor, PWM-capable LEDs, and the LCD display with I2C.

Define the pin connections in the code:

The button is connected to pin 2.

The motor is connected to pin 9.

The PWM-capable LEDs are connected to pins 3, 5, 6, 10, and 11.

Initialize the LCD display with I2C address 0x27.

In the setup() function, configure the pin modes for the button, motor, and LEDs.

Initialize the LCD display and set the backlight. Display a startup message on the LCD.

In the loop() function, continuously monitor the state of the push button.

When the button is pressed, increment the gear value, cycling through gears 1 to 5.

For each gear, calculate the corresponding PWM value (multiplying the gear number by 51 to get a range from 0 to 255).

Write the PWM value to the motor pin using analogWrite(), controlling the motor speed.

Update the LCD display with the current gear and PWM value.

Gradually adjust the brightness of the 5 LEDs based on the current PWM value. The LED brightness increases as the PWM value rises.

Loop back to check the button state again for the next press. The system will update the display and LED behavior accordingly.

Repeat this process until the project is powered off or reset.

This workflow outlines how the system functions, from button interaction to controlling the motor and LED display.
